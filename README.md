zrecommerce-storefront-wordpress
================================

ZRECommerce store front (eCommerce) application stack that consumes the zrecore-js REST service. This is the WordPress (PHP) implementation.

Currently a work in progress within the version-1.0 branch. Releases are identified as 'release-X.x', where X is the major version, and x is the minor version.

The 'zrecommerce-storefront-wordpress' theme is editable (fork it, and check a copy out to your wp-content folder). Uses Bourbon Neat/Bitters/Refills.

You will need to set up your own server to host a copy of the 'zrecore-js' service provider (available as an npm package!). See the zrecore-js repository.
